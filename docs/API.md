## Error envelope

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_IMAGE",
    "message": "Uploaded image is not supported.",
    "details": {}
  },
  "request_id": "…"
}
```

Success responses use a consistent envelope with `success: true` and a `data` payload (Phase 3+).
